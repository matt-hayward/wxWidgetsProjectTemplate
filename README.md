# wxWidgets Project Template

This is a template base project to get you started with a [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/) C++ project in Visual Studio 2017.

The set up is based on the first part of the [Cross Platform Graphical User Interfaces in C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOIbK4bJKS8) YouTube video by [javidx9](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA).

## Pre-Requisites

This template assumes the following:

1. You have already installed/built wxWidgets on your machine
1. You have set up an environment window called `WXWIN` which points to the install location of the built wxWidgets SDK

Both of these steps are covered the video linked aboved.

## Differences to the video

I do not like Hungarian Notation, so while javidx9's video includes it, this project does not.

Because the project is pre-set up, you do not need to define additional libraries etc.

## How to use

1. Clone this repo, or use the template repository feature in GitHub to create your own repo (see [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template))
1. Open solution in Visual Studio
1. Click run
